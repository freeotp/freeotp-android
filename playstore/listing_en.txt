FreeOTP Authenticator
******************** Short description in locale <en> ********************

******************** Full description in locale <en> ********************
FreeOTP adds a second layer of security for your online accounts. This works by generating one-time passwords on your mobile devices which can be used in conjunction with your normal password to make your login nearly impossible to hack. These passwords can be generated even when your phone is in airplane mode.

FreeOTP works with many of the great online services you already use, including Google, Facebook, Evernote, GitHub and many more! FreeOTP also may work for your private corporate security if they implement the standardized TOTP or HOTP protocols. This includes great enterprise solutions like FreeIPA.

FreeOTP is open source and free software! Licensed under the Apache 2.0 license, you can obtain the source code for FreeOTP at https://freeotp.github.io for review or modification. Contributions are welcome!
